Welcome to our game, Odyssey!

Anxiety and depression are two of the most common mental health struggles faced by teenagers today.
Half of all mental health conditions start by the age of 14, but most cases go undetected and untreated.
Many teens experience symptoms they can’t identify, much less express to others. Too often teens absentmindedly reach for
their phones when they feel exhausted, unmotivated, restless, stressed, or bored. This can become an unhealthy habit
that not only impacts the quality of their sleep but also the way they think and see themselves. Technology and
social media seem only to worsen mental health issues.

That’s why we created Odyssey. We created this game to help teenagers understand depression and anxiety, and
it can also provide an educational experience to those who do not struggle with their mental health.

Odyssey’s easy-to-understand format works to build empathy and understanding,
crucial elements of connecting with others and expanding perspectives.
